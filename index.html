<p>I’m a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering department at Johns Hopkins University, and I’m conducting research in computational biology at the Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Institute.</p>
<h3 id="research-interests">research interests</h3>
<p>My main research interest lies at the intersection of statistical inference / machine learning and genomics.</p>
<h3 id="bio">bio</h3>
<p>I received my BS in Industrial Engineering from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, where I majored in signal processing. During my undergraduate, I served as the Team Captain of the ETSEIB Formula Student team, where I helped develop the first electric vehicle for the school. After graduating, I went on to obtain an MS from the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering department at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. There, I joined the Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering, where I was involved in several computational genomics research projects under Dr. Aniruddha Datta. In 2015, I was awarded the prestigious “la Caixa” fellowship to pursue research in computational biology during my PhD. For the past four years, I have been a member of the Goutsias lab, developing computational methods to study epigenetic signatures in close collaboration with the Feinberg lab of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In addition to my research and PhD coursework, I earned an MS focused on statistical learning from the Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics department at Johns Hopkins in 2018.</p>
