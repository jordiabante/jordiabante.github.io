<p>I’m a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering department at Johns Hopkins University, and I’m conducting research in computational biology at the Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Institute.</p>
<h3 id="research-interests">research interests</h3>
<p>My main research interest lies at the intersection of statistical inference/machine learning and genomics/epigenetics.</p>
<p>During my Ph.D., I have been mostly concerned with modeling DNA methylation leveraging statistical physics and information theory concepts. My work builds upon that of Jenkinson et al. 2017 &amp; 2018, where the epigenetic landscape once envisioned by Conrad Waddington in the 1940s came to a reality for the first time. This first potential energy landscape accounted for the genome&rsquo;s architecture, and its application resulted in several novel biological findings. The seminal work in Jenkinson et al. 2017 &amp; 2018 laid the groundwork for the models and methods I have developed during my Ph.D..</p>
<p>In moving forward, I am particularly interested in the application of deep generative models to multi-modal single-cell data. On the one hand, deep generative models' great expressivity can capture complex non-linear relationships present in single-cell data. On the other hand, single-cell data provides an unprecedented resolution at a large scale, allowing us to fill gaps in our knowledge derived from ensemble-level analysis. These measurements, however, pose big challenges given the high dimensionality and complexity of the data, which can be effectively addressed with deep generative models.</p>
<h3 id="bio">bio</h3>
<p>I received my BS in Industrial Engineering from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, where I majored in signal processing. During my undergraduate, I served as the Team Captain of the ETSEIB Formula Student team, where I helped develop the first electric vehicle for the school. After graduating, I went on to obtain an MS from the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering department at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. There, I joined the Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering, where I was involved in several computational genomics research projects under Dr. Aniruddha Datta. In 2015, I was awarded the “la Caixa” fellowship to pursue research in computational biology during my PhD. For the past four years, I have been a member of the Goutsias lab, developing computational methods to study epigenetic signatures in close collaboration with the Feinberg lab of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In addition to my research and PhD coursework, I earned an MS focused on statistical learning from the Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics department at Johns Hopkins in 2018. In Fall 2021, I will be joining Salzman&rsquo;s lab at Stanford to continue my academic training.</p>
