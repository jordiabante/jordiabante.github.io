On May 10 of 2021, I successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation entitled &ldquo;Statistical Signal Processing Methods for Epigenetic Landscape Analysis&rdquo; at the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering department at Johns Hopkins University. In September 2021, I joined the Salzman&rsquo;s lab as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Biomedical Data Science Department at Stanford University, as well as the Stanford Center for Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics.</p>
<h3 id="research-interests">research interests</h3>
<p>My main research interest lies at the intersection of statistical inference/machine learning and genomics/epigenetics.</p>
<p>During my Ph.D., I have been mostly concerned with statistical modeling 5mc DNA methylation. My work built upon that of Jenkinson et al. 2017 &amp; 2018, where the epigenetic landscape once envisioned by Conrad Waddington in the 1940s came to a reality for the first time. This first potential energy landscape accounted for the genome&rsquo;s architecture, and its application resulted in several novel biological findings. The seminal work in Jenkinson et al. 2017 &amp; 2018 laid the groundwork for the models and methods I developed during my doctoral studies.</p>
<p>Currently, I am particularly interested in the development of novel computational methods, based on deep generative models, for single-cell (meta)genomics and (meta)transcriptomics data. On the one hand, deep generative models' great expressivity can capture complex non-linear relationships present in single-cell data that customary statistical models fail to identify. On the other hand, single-cell data provides an unprecedented resolution at a large scale, allowing us to fill gaps in our knowledge derived from ensemble-level analysis. These measurements, however, pose big challenges given the high dimensionality and complexity of the data, which can be effectively addressed with recent advances in deep generative models and optimization.</p>

<p>In 2014 I received my BS in Industrial Engineering from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, where I majored in power electronics and signals. During my undergraduate, I served as the Team Captain of the ETSEIB Formula Student team, where I helped develop the first electric vehicle for the school. After graduating, I went on to obtain an MS from the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering department at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. There, I joined the Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering, where I was involved in several computational genomics research projects under Dr. Aniruddha Datta. In 2015, I was awarded the “la Caixa” fellowship to pursue research in computational biology during my Ph.D. as a member of the Goutsias lab, developing computational methods to study epigenetic signatures in close collaboration with the Feinberg lab of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In addition to my research and Ph.D. coursework, I earned an MS focused on statistical learning from the Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics department at Johns Hopkins University in 2018. After successfully defending my dissertation entitled &ldquo;Statistical Signal Processing Methods for Epigenetic Landscape Analysis&rdquo; on May 10 of 2021, I joined Salzman&rsquo;s lab at Stanford University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow being awarded the postdoctoral fellowship from the Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics.</p>
